= OpenShift Online Operations Docker Containers

This directory contains the OpenShift Online Operations docker containers.

These containers are used for various things, some are specific just to OpenShift Online, but in an effort to be as open as possible, we're sharing these here.

We hope you find them useful.

== Setup
All containers in this directory expect a secrets directory to be setup with a structure like:

[source]
----
/etc/pki/entitlement
└── yum
    ├── certs
    │   ├── client-cert.pem
    │   └── client-key.pem
    ├── repos
    │   ├── oo-ops-rpm.repo
    │   ├── oso-rhui-rhel-7-extras.repo
    │   └── oso-rhui-rhel-7-server.repo
    └── rpm-gpg
        └── RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
----

== Structure

.All containers in this directory should have the following files:
* README.adoc - Information specific to the container
* build.sh - a script to make building the container easy
* run.sh - a script to make running the container easy
