=== Description
This folder contains vendored versions of the OpenShift v3 Installer (aka BYO playbooks).

The purpose of vendoring the installer is to allow for multiple stable versions to be used.

The vendored installers are autognerated using the vendor-rpms.yml script. DO NOT edit the vendored contents directly.
